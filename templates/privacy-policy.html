    <span> <p>Privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation</p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets a high bar for global privacy rights and compliance. Since our customers can sign up to our mailing list, we need to ensure we are compliant.

        DROPOUT do not and have never collected email addresses from any sources other than:
        
        By opting in online through our website (explicit consent requires that each contact takes an action to consent).
        By signing up at an event on our physical mailing list forms (requiring the contact to fill-in their own details).
        You can unsubscribe at any point and you will be deleted from our list.
        
        These new regulations mean that you have the following rights:
        
        The right to be informed: companies must publish a privacy notice, in addition to explaining transparently how they use this personal data.
        The right of access: individuals will have the right to demand details of any of their data that a company may hold. This information must be provided within 30 days.
        The right to rectification: if a person‚Äôs data is incorrect or incomplete, he or she has the right to have it corrected. If the company that holds the information has passed any of that information to third parties, the company must inform the third party of the correction and inform the person which third parties have their personal data.
        The right to be forgotten: a person may request the removal of his or her personal data in specific circumstances.
        The right to restrict processing: under certain circumstances, an individual can block the processing of his or her personal data.
        The right to data portability: a person can access their data for their own use anywhere they prefer.
        The right to object: a person can object to the use of their personal data for most purposes.

We‚Äôre continuously working to reset the bar for ourselves in the security and data privacy realm, and view the GDPR as an opportunity for the entire industry to come together on this and improve.‚Äò
        
        ‚ÄòStripe started its efforts towards GDPR compliance back in 2016, and we are working to ensure that our services are GDPR-compliant on the effective date of May 25, 2018.‚Äô
